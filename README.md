SKOS Play is a free application to work with thesaurus or classification expressed in [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-skos-reference-20090818/).

With SKOS Play you can :
  1. Print / visualize thesaurus
  2. Convert Excel tables to SKOS
  3. Validate SKOS files

### Print / visualize thesaurus

#### Generate different outputs

SKOS Play can print your thesaurus in various ways :

##### Alphabetical indexes

##### Hierarchical trees (static or unfoldable)

##### Translation tables

##### Permuted / KWIC indexes

##### Alignment tables


#### Generate PDF files

SKOS Play can also be used to produce printable PDFs from your thesaurus, with the same kind of outputs as the ones described above. PDFs are clickable so you can navigate the content of your thesaurus within the PDF.

#### Cool dataviz with D3JS

SKOS Play leverages D3js to display the hierarchy of the SKOS structure in nice ways :

##### Tree-like visualization

##### Square visualization

##### Circle visualization

SKOS Play also illustrates the generation of an autocomplete form filled with your thesaurus labels :




### Create SKOS classifications from Excel / Google spreadsheets

The SKOS Play converter is a tool to easily maintain classifications in Excel and turn them into SKOS, following a simple file template, with specific column headers.

The converter is also integrated with Google Spreadsheets, so you can even maintain your classification collaboratively, and turn it directly into SKOS !

###Â Validate / test SKOS files

SKOS Play includes a frontend for the qSKOS validator, hosted in a separate project : [SKOS-testing-tool](https://github.com/sparna-git/skos-testing-tool)

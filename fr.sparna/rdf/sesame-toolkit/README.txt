	- SPARQL Helper mechanism that allows easy SPARQL query execution and handling of results
	- SesameSPARQLExecuter that wraps redundant SPARQL execution code
	- A set of utility query handlers to process query results : generate CSV, sort, split, count or copy results.
	- Bounded description generation classes
	- RepositoryWriter to easily write repository contents to an RDF file, including proper sorting of RDF/XML triples to garantee the serialisation
